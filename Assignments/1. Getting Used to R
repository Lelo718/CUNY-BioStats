Before doing this, review the 1. Welcome and Intro lecture set slides and the  1_intro_data_lecture.R script in the lectures folder of CUNY-BioStats github repository 

##R subtleties and functions

1. Let x be defined by
```{r}
 x <- 1:10
```

Determine what the “:” does!  Then try to guess the output of these commands, and then verify:
*length(x)
*max(x)
*x[x < 5]
*x^2
*x[ x < 8 & x > 2]

INSERT AN R CHUNK HERE.  Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.  THEN INPUT THESE COMMANDS.

2.Factors must be respected as such, as they behave differently than expected. To see this, what are the results of these commands:
*f <- factor(2:4)
*mean(f)
*mean(as.numeric(f))	
*mean(as.numeric(as.character(f)))

The last one is what you likely expected for the second command.

3.  Is -1:2 the same as (-1):2 or -(1:2)?
