Before doing this, review the 1. Welcome and Intro lecture set slides and
the  1_intro_data_lecture.R script in the lectures folder of CUNY-BioStats
github repository

## Getting your first repository
At this point I'm assuming you received the invitation to view the assignment
on github classroom and accepted it. You now have a private repository of these files.  In addition to working on R, we'll have you connect your first
project on Rstudio to this repository and work on some basic git skills.

First, open RStudio (on your desktop or cloudserver).  Select file, new
project, Version control.  On the next screen select git. Next you'll need to
enter the url for your repository. Navigate to the web home of your github
repository and for the green **Code** button. Click it, then copy the web url
(or click the copy icon). Input that into the Rstudio **Repository URL**
space.  Then name the project (maybe Assignment 1?).  The **Create
project...** field can be left blank to just save all projects into the main
directory. Alternatively you can click **Browse** and make an Assignments
folder if you want. Whatever you choose, the project will be saved in new
folder in that location using the name you chose.

First, amend the file by replacing the **NAME** spot in the header (top of the
file between the --- markers) with your name.  Now lets make our first commit.
If you look in the upper right windoes, you should see a *Git* tab.  Select it.  Notice nothing is there. Save the file (using the **Disk** icon or file save).  Two things will happen.  A file will appear in the Git tab, and it may be covered (immediately) by a preview of this file.  You should see your name in the preview!  

Go back to the git tab, click the checkbox next to the file, and select **Commit**.  You'll need to enter a description. Put "My first commit!" and press Commit.  



## R subtleties and functions

1. Let x be defined by


```{r}
 x <- 1:10
```
Try executing this chunk (in R studio, not the webview) by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

This will run the code in the Console.  When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and the most recent output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


Determine what the “:” does!  Then try to guess the output of these commands

* length(x)
* max(x)
* x[x < 5]
* x^2
* x[ x < 8 & x > 2]

INSERT AN R CHUNK HERE AND RUN EACH OF THESE COMMANDS?  Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
